I think both scripts are fully working. To run them, they go in whatever directory the TextGrids are in, just like the original files.

The work flow is:
1a) Create the TextGrids with the aligner
1b) Run woi_IPA_column.praat to append the dictionary transcription to the experiment file
Ideally these two steps are done together to make sure the same dictionary is used.

2) Manually add underscores and labels (I think only 1 character labels will work, but I can change that if necessary) to segments of interest in Excel. It should be pretty quick using search and replace.

3) Run annotate_soi.praat to add a tier for segments of interest. It's not the fastest script in the world, but it works! The user has to make sure soi_file is equal to the same new_file the woi_IPA_column script spits out.

EDIT: I've marked the woi_IPA_column.praat script and its output as yellow. I've marked the annotate_soi.praat script and its outputs in green. Originals are marked in blue.
